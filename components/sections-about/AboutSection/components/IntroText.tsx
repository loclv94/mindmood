          At mindmood, we’re driven by a singular mission: to make mental health
          support accessible and affordable for all. Recognizing the diminishing
          stigma surrounding mental health, we’ve observed a surge in
          individuals seeking assistance. However, with growing waiting lists
          and financial constraints, many find themselves unable to access the
          care they need. Moreover, existing online support often falls short in
          catering to diverse identities, lacking a sex-positive and LGBTQ+
          affirming approach.
